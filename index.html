        <p>Cloud Computing relates to me and because of my course am doing. I want to understand more so that when I am done with BASIS Programme and luckily get a job, I would be able to use this research knowledge and apply it. There are so many things involved in cloud computing which make it more appealing for instances scalability, the cost involved, accessibility and innovation and also reliability. This combination that has attracted big organization to use it and grow their business is what amazes me. I will use the 7 pillars of literacy to in my research where I will involve surveys and interviews to get more info.

            Blogs and online communities have been my biggest help on my research, Academic journals also have been of big help.
            
            Now, in cloud computing is the computer services one get through the internet which is very cost efficiency, accessible, without owning any physical infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>Exploring the Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing?</h3>
            <p>I have completed some courses that cover cloud computing and i feel like i can use my knowledge, online/internet to help me work on my research. For example, Today am going to talk about things i have learnt to make or keep our information safe in CLoud Computing. Security is like a big shield to protect us from unauthorized acces by bad people. Encryption and authentication are some of the way to  us safe. It is not only Cloud Computing companies, but it is team work to keep things secure. Privacy is very important because keepingo ur information private so that noone cn access them without our permission.Using things like CCPA (or California Consumer Privacy Act). I used this  to get some information
                https://www.academia.edu/40733822/CLOUD_COMPUTING_Cloud_Computing_Overview?sm=b. Using my topic Cloud Computing helps me to narrow down most of my area of discussion and the resources to use. The 3 things that i know about my Security and privacy are:-
                <ol>
                    <li>  Shared Responsibility - Security and privacy in cloud computing is a team effort between the service provider and the customer</li>
                    <li>  Privacy-Enhancing Technologies - Variuos technology to enhance privacy is used to proctect our data and infortion. Encrption and authentication are some of them.</li>
                    <li>  Regulatory Compliance - Using CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), is very crucialso that we can maintain our data in the cloud. </li>
                </ol>
                  Questions that arise specifically when talking about security, but on my own the question that arise are time management, where to find resources and technology issues for example what is my computer crash, will i finish my research?
                   <ol>
                    <li>is the user awareness and the level of education both the user and organization aware of the security implications when using cloud computing services? What actions are taken to educate the users on the best practice?</li>
                    <li>Another question is ethecal considerations associated witn the data collection,storage and processing in the cloud specifically when it comes to sensitive or personal information? But in Security and Privacy of cloud computing , this is what arises. </li>
                    <li>Also, What are the legal/regulatory issues?</li>
                </ol></p>

        <h2>Module 1: Progress Report</h2>
        <p>I have picked Cloud Computer to be my research journey, I know it is a broad topic, but I will try to do more research and cover the most important topics..
            In my research Journey I will try to cover:- What is Cloud Computing, The cost, The Security involved, and even the software used in cloud computing
            Cloud Computing is very complex more so the emergency of AI. The issues I think I will run into is the overall understanding how it works. And to overcome this is to do more research whereby I will involve my Professors to help me understand cloud computing. I will use AI to study and utilize the library.
            My next step is to explore and use the 7 pillars of information literacy to guide me through the research</p>

                <h2>Module 2: Progress Report</h2>
                <p>Going through my topic of research <b>Cloud  Computing</b>, this is what i have prepared to work on:-
    
                    <ol>
                        <li>  I will use the Libray, my fellow classmates and my Professor as my resource</li>
                        <li>  I have developed my research startegy whereby i will allocate my time evenly in every topic i will cover specifically for my research</li>
                        <li>  I will gather the information i need before isatrt sampling</li>
                        <li>  I will make sure my research is thoroughly evaluated before making infprmed decisions</li>
                        <li>  Make sure the research am working on is thoroughly reviewd, organized, prodiced and completed successfully</li>
                        <li> AFter i finish my research i will be able to share a well organized, and thoroughly researched information to my classmates. </li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>This week was very productive because my group helped me to understand fully about my topic of research. Things they were able to clarify and make me understand is how to go about getting resources for refernces toward my reaserch.  Another thing was time management where i need to set aside time to evenly tackle each section and get more information for my research. Also was about using technology to record or store my work. Now, since i identified,defined my research topic, i going in fully swing to start getting my resources for my research project</p>

        <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>I'm going to talk about Cloud Computing and how it has affected organizations. Many businesses and individuals, in general, are looking for ways to make their IT infrastructure safe and efficient. First, what is Cloud Computing? This is the process by which computing services are delivered, for example, servers, storage, databases, networking software, and hardware, through the internet.</p>

        <h2>Module 1: Lab Activity-Week 2</h2>
        <p>The reason why i chose cloud computing is the benefits it offers to individuals and business. For example, it is cost effective, very flexible, good for storing large amount of data, and also  very reliable when it comes to application hosting. Looking on those options it makes it a number one choice for many organizations. Thee questions that arised from the group was like, acceptance-Many people dont accept change that quick because most of them dont understand technology and the only solution for that is to keep on educating then about the tecnology. Another quetion is how will virtualization technology work with cloud computing?, Another question was about other cloud computing providers and their charges?. The discussion really helped me to add more benefits to my cloud computing research. Security, innovation, reliability, accessibility, cost and the scalality are some of the points my group discussed and am going to expound on them so that i can come up with a good report. </p>
