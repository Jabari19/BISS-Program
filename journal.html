        <p>Cloud Computing relates to me and because of my course am doing. I want to understand more so that when I am done with BASIS Programme and luckily get a job, I would be able to use this research knowledge and apply it. There are so many things involved in cloud computing which make it more appealing for instances scalability, the cost involved, accessibility and innovation and also reliability. This combination that has attracted big organization to use it and grow their business is what amazes me. I will use the 7 pillars of literacy to in my research where I will involve surveys and interviews to get more info.

            Blogs and online communities have been my biggest help on my research, Academic journals also have been of big help.
            
            Now, in cloud computing is the computer services one get through the internet which is very cost efficiency, accessible, without owning any physical infrastructure.</p>

                <h3>Exploring the Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing?</h3>
                <p>I have completed some courses that cover cloud computing and i feel like i can use my knowledge, online/internet to help me work on my research. For example, Today am going to talk about things i have learnt to make or keep our information safe in CLoud Computing. Security is like a big shield to protect us from unauthorized acces by bad people. Encryption and authentication are some of the way to  us safe. It is not only Cloud Computing companies, but it is team work to keep things secure. Privacy is very important because keepingo ur information private so that noone cn access them without our permission.Using things like CCPA (or California Consumer Privacy Act). I used this  to get some information
                    https://www.academia.edu/40733822/CLOUD_COMPUTING_Cloud_Computing_Overview?sm=b. Using my topic Cloud Computing helps me to narrow down most of my area of discussion and the resources to use. The 3 things that i know about my Security and privacy are:-
                    <ol>
                        <li>  Shared Responsibility - Security and privacy in cloud computing is a team effort between the service provider and the customer</li>
                        <li>  Privacy-Enhancing Technologies - Variuos technology to enhance privacy is used to proctect our data and infortion. Encrption and authentication are some of them.</li>
                        <li>  Regulatory Compliance - Using CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), is very crucialso that we can maintain our data in the cloud. </li>
                    </ol>
                      Questions that arise specifically when talking about security, but on my own the question that arise are time management, where to find resources and technology issues for example what is my computer crash, will i finish my research?
                       <ol>
                        <li>is the user awareness and the level of education both the user and organization aware of the security implications when using cloud computing services? What actions are taken to educate the users on the best practice?</li>
                        <li>Another question is ethecal considerations associated witn the data collection,storage and processing in the cloud specifically when it comes to sensitive or personal information? But in Security and Privacy of cloud computing , this is what arises. </li>
                        <li>Also, What are the legal/regulatory issues?</li>
                    </ol></p>
