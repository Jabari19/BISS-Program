            <h3>Week 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing</h3>
            <p>This is a lab activity report for Week 1, where we learned about the basics of cloud computing. The reason why i chose cloud computing is the benefits it offers to individuals and business. For example, it is cost effective, very flexible, good for storing large amount of data, and also  very reliable when it comes to application hosting. Looking on those options it makes it a number one choice for many organizations. Thee questions that arised from the group was like, acceptance-Many people dont accept change that quick because most of them dont understand technology and the only solution for that is to keep on educating then about the tecnology. Another quetion is how will virtualization technology work with cloud computing?, Another question was about other cloud computing providers and their charges?. The discussion really helped me to add more benefits to my cloud computing research. Security, innovation, reliability, accessibility, cost and the scalality are some of the points my group discussed and am going to expound on them so that i can come up with a good report. </p>
