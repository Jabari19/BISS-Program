            <h3>Module 1: Progress Report</h3>
            <p>I have picked Cloud Computer to be my research journey, I know it is a broad topic, but I will try to do more research and cover the most important topics..
                In my research Journey I will try to cover:- What is Cloud Computing, The cost, The Security involved, and even the software used in cloud computing
                Cloud Computing is very complex more so the emergency of AI. The issues I think I will run into is the overall understanding how it works. And to overcome this is to do more research whereby I will involve my Professors to help me understand cloud computing. I will use AI to study and utilize the library.
                My next step is to explore and use the 7 pillars of information literacy to guide me through the research</p>

            <h3>Module 2: Progress Report</h3>
            <p>Going through my topic of research <b>Cloud  Computing</b>, this is what i have prepared to work on:-

                <ol>
                    <li>  I will use the Libray, my fellow classmates and my Professor as my resource</li>
                    <li>  I have developed my research startegy whereby i will allocate my time evenly in every topic i will cover specifically for my research</li>
                    <li>  I will gather the information i need before isatrt sampling</li>
                    <li>  I will make sure my research is thoroughly evaluated before making infprmed decisions</li>
                    <li>  Make sure the research am working on is thoroughly reviewd, organized, prodiced and completed successfully</li>
                    <li> AFter i finish my research i will be able to share a well organized, and thoroughly researched information to my classmates. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>This week was very productive because my group helped me to understand fully about my topic of research. Things they were able to clarify and make me understand is how to go about getting resources for refernces toward my reaserch.  Another thing was time management where i need to set aside time to evenly tackle each section and get more information for my research. Also was about using technology to record or store my work. Now, since i identified,defined my research topic, i going in fully swing to start getting my resources for my research project</p>
